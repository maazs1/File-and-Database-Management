# File-and-Database-Management
This is a program that authenticates users from a database and allows them to manage rides, 
bookings, and requests. The program runs in Python 3 and the interface is based around the 
system terminal/shell. To run, you need to specify the path to the database. 
The database needs to exist, and cannot be created from inside the program.
